# SnapHide

An iOS tweak to hide jailbreak and hooks from Snapchat.

> Keep in mind that the current version was created for **Snapchat 10.65.0.66 (832559634)**. Things **may or may not be different** in other versions so keep that in mind when using this tweak with a different version. If you want me to check one, create an issue and I will take a look if it is safe. Same goes for compatibility with tweaks like Wraith.

## Research

To see the research this tweak was created from, see: https://aeonlucid.com/Snapchat-detection-on-iOS/  
It also talks about why [NoSub](https://github.com/NepetaDev/UnSub) won't be good enough for Snapchat.

## Installation

Add the `https://aeonlucid.com/cydia/` repository in Cydia.
